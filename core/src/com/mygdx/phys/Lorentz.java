/*
    The Lorentz force is the force on a charged particle due to electric and magnetic fields.
    Formula: Force = charge * velocity x magnetic field density

do a perpendicular dot product
make a new vector 90 degrees to the left with the magnitude of the scalar you get from (v0.x*v1.y)-(v0.y*v1.x)

Angular momentum    = mass * velocity * radius
Angular velocity    = change in angular motion / change in time
Moment of inertia   = angular momentum / angular velocity
